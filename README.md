This Arduino Mega project demonstrates a basic keypad scanning algorithm using only C, without any Arduino built-in functions. The program scans each column of the 4x4 keypad, reads the row inputs, and determines which button is pressed. When a button press is detected, a corresponding LED lights up, providing a visual indication of the pressed button. This project is useful for applications requiring user input through a keypad, such as security systems, access control, or menu navigation interfaces. Additionally, because it is implemented entirely in C, it can be adapted for use with other microcontrollers with proper abstraction layers.
